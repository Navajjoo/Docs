# üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

**Completed Steps**

**1. Creation of iNFT Registry for Lands, Real Estate, and Planets**

* Full deployment of a secure **iNFT registry**, linking ownership of LAND, real estate, and celestial assets (planets, moons, asteroids) to a blockchain-verified system.
* All iNFTs include **intelligent AI integration**, enabling adaptive interactions, guidance, and analytics for owners.

**2. Launch of Interactive Metaverse Map**

* Release of a **dynamic, AI-enhanced metaverse map** allowing real-time visualization of land plots, real estate, and planetary assets.
* Map includes **resource analysis, environmental data, and predictive modeling** to optimize land and planetary usage.

**3. Release of Rainbowland Coin ‚Äì $RaVerse**

* Introduced $RaVerse as the **primary economic instrument** within Rainbowland.
* Actively used for rewards, staking, trading, and supporting AI-driven automation of economic and social systems.

**4. iNFT Collection for Ownership**

* Public release of **iNFTs representing LAND, buildings, and planets**, each enhanced by AI.
* iNFTs function as **intelligent companions, guides, and managers**, capable of interacting with owners, suggesting optimizations, and monitoring asset performance.
