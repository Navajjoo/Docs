# üè≠ What is $PRIDE used for?

$PRIDE is more than just a coin, it is a symbol of support for the LGBTQ+ community and a tool for positive change. As a utility coin on the Ethereum blockchain, $PRIDE can be used for a variety of purposes, both within the Rainbowland Metaverse and beyond.

Within the Metaverse, $PRIDE can be used to purchase virtual assets, such as clothing, accessories, and other items to personalize avatars and enhance the gaming experience. The Metaverse also hosts a variety of games, competitions, and events, where $PRIDE can be used as a form of currency for entry fees, prizes, and other rewards.

$PRIDE can also be used outside of the Metaverse, with the potential for adoption in real-world businesses and events. For example, hotels and resorts around the world can accept $PRIDE as a form of payment, offering discounts and special perks for LGBTQ+ travelers. Pride festivals and events can also utilize $PRIDE as a way to purchase tickets, merchandise, and other goods, with a portion of proceeds going towards supporting LGBTQ+ organizations and causes.

The potential uses for $PRIDE extend even further into the world of NFTs.
