# üè≠ What is $RaVerse used for?

‚öúÔ∏è The Rainbowland is a new Metaverse that has recently launched its coin on the Polygon blockchain. The launch of the $RaVerse coin on Polygon is a significant milestone for the project as it provides the platform with the necessary infrastructure to support its vision. Polygon, also known as Matic Network, is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that enables faster and cheaper transactions compared to the Ethereum mainnet. This makes it an ideal platform for RaVerse to operate on.

$RaVerse is a part of the Rainbowland Metaverse, which is a decentralized platform for buying, selling, and trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as well as other cryptocurrencies. The Rainbowland Metaverse is an innovative gaming platform that aims to provide a unique and interactive gaming experience to users. The metaverse provides users with the ability to interact with each other in a virtual world, play games, buy and sell virtual assets, and earn rewards.

One of the key features of the $RaVerse platform is its new function for staking. Staking is a process where users hold their coins in a wallet to support the network's operations and receive rewards in return. The staking feature in $RaVerse allows users to stake their coins and earn a 9% annual reward on their investment. This provides an opportunity for users to earn passive income by simply holding onto their coins.

In addition to its staking feature, $RaVerse coin is also a gaming asset and utility. This means that users can use the coin to purchase virtual assets and unlock various features within the Rainbowland Metaverse. The $RaVerse coin is an essential part of the platform, as it provides users with the ability to participate in the various activities and games available in the Metaverse.

Overall, the launch of $RaVerse coin on the Polygon blockchain and its staking feature is a significant development for the Rainbowland Metaverse. The staking feature provides users with an opportunity to earn passive income, while the $RaVerse coin serves as a gaming asset and utility. The Rainbowland Metaverse is an exciting project that aims to revolutionize the gaming industry by providing a unique and interactive gaming experience to users.
