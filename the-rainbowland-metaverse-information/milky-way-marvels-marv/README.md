# ðŸŒŽ Milky Way Marvels (MARV)

Greetings from the Rainbowland Metaverse development team! We understand the importance of ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience for our users, particularly when it comes to the distribution of Crypto Planets (Layer 1) to Milky Way Marvels (MARV) (Layer 2) on the Polygon blockchain.

To make this process as simple as possible, we've designed a user-friendly and automated system. Here's how it works:

1. Once users successfully purchase Crypto Planets on Layer 1 (Cronos) via the Crypto.com NFT Marketplace, our system will automatically detect the ownership of these unique virtual planets.
2. The system will then cross-reference the ownership information with the corresponding Milky Way Marvels collections on Layer 2 (Polygon).
3. Users who own Crypto Planets on Layer 1 will be eligible to access the equivalent Layer 2 Milky Way Marvels, which may vary in design or features, offering a diverse range of options. Our smart contract will facilitate the distribution, ensuring the process is secure and transparent.

For example, if a member owns a collection of 3 Crypto Planets on Layer 1, they will be able to access the corresponding Layer 2 Milky Way Marvels. This process will be seamless and won't require any additional input from the user.

By implementing this straightforward and efficient system, we aim to enhance user experience and facilitate a seamless transition between the two layers, allowing our users to fully enjoy the benefits and opportunities offered by the Rainbowland Metaverse.

We are committed to ensuring the best experience for our community members as they explore, learn, and have fun in the Rainbowland Metaverse. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to seeing you in our virtual world!
