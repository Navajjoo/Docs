# 🏝 The Rainbowland Metaverse LANDs

Welcome to the Rainbowland Metaverse LANDs sale! We are excited to introduce our innovative virtual world, powered by advanced AI technology, offering endless opportunities for play, education, and entertainment. Our vision is to create an immersive and vibrant ecosystem where people can explore, learn, have fun, and earn rewards.

To achieve this, we've designed the Rainbowland Metaverse using a two-layer structure:

**Layer 1:** The Rainbowland Metaverse LANDs on Cryptocom NFT Marketplace, built on the Cronos blockchain. \
**Layer 2:** The Rainbowland Metaverse LANDs on Polygon blockchain, accessible through OpenSea and Rarible marketplaces.

Each land parcel measures 16m x 16m (256 sq.m. or 2755 sq.ft., equivalent to 0.063 acres).

The LANDs sale will be conducted in four stages: Early Bid, Main Bid, Exclusive, and Public Sale, with each stage offering unique opportunities and benefits.

But why are we using two different blockchains for Layer 1 and Layer 2?

The reason for this decision lies in the unique advantages offered by each blockchain:

1. Cronos (Layer 1): Cronos is a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain that allows for seamless integration with Crypto.com's NFT Marketplace. By utilizing Cronos, we can offer a more streamlined experience for our users, while also capitalizing on the growing popularity of the Crypto.com ecosystem.
2. Polygon (Layer 2): Polygon is a well-known Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. By incorporating Polygon, we can expand our reach to include popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible, providing our users with more options to trade and interact with their LANDs.

To support development and encourage adoption, we will pre-mint 170,000 LANDs on Layer 2 (Polygon) and distribute them for free to owners of the same coordinates on Layer 1 (Cronos) via the Crypto.com NFT Marketplace.

This dual-layer approach allows us to combine the best of both worlds - the security and integration of Cronos, and the speed and cost-efficiency of Polygon, ensuring a seamless, immersive, and rewarding experience for our users in the Rainbowland Metaverse.

Join us today and become a part of the Metaverse Ecosystem with limitless possibilities!
