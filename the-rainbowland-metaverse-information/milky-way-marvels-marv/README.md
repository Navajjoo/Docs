# ðŸŒŽ Milky Way Marvels (MARV)

Welcome to the Rainbowland Metaverse Milky Way Marvels (MARV) sale! We are excited to introduce our innovative virtual world, powered by advanced AI technology, offering endless opportunities for play, education, and entertainment. Our vision is to create an immersive and vibrant ecosystem where people can explore, learn, have fun, and earn rewards.

To achieve this, we've designed the Rainbowland Metaverse using a two-layer structure:

[<mark style="color:blue;">**Layer 1: The Rainbowland Metaverse Crypto Planets on Crypto.com NFT Marketplace, built on the Crypto.org Chain.**</mark> ](https://crypto.com/nft/collection/a0c187dd7b67666acdc6644b95e1f177)\
[<mark style="color:purple;">**Layer 2: The Rainbowland Metaverse Milky Way Marvels (MARV) on Polygon blockchain, accessible through OpenSea and Rarible marketplaces.**</mark>](https://opensea.io/collection/milky-way-marvels)

Each Crypto Planet and Milky Way Marvel is a unique and valuable NFT collectible within the Rainbowland Metaverse.

The MARV sale will be conducted in four stages: Early Bid, Main Bid, Exclusive, and Public Sale, with each stage offering unique opportunities and benefits.

But why are we using two different blockchains for Layer 1 and Layer 2?

The reason for this decision lies in the unique advantages offered by each blockchain:

Crypto.org Chain (Layer 1): The Crypto.org Chain is a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain that allows for seamless integration with Crypto.com's NFT Marketplace. By utilizing the Crypto.org Chain, we can offer a more streamlined experience for our users, while also capitalizing on the growing popularity of the Crypto.com ecosystem.

Polygon (Layer 2): Polygon is a well-known Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, enabling faster and cheaper transactions. By incorporating Polygon, we can expand our reach to include popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible, providing our users with more options to trade and interact with their Milky Way Marvels (MARV).

To support development and encourage adoption, we will pre-mint a limited number of Milky Way Marvels (MARV) on Layer 2 (Polygon) and distribute them for free to owners of the corresponding Crypto Planets on Layer 1 (Crypto.org Chain) via the Crypto.com NFT Marketplace.

This dual-layer approach allows us to combine the best of both worlds - the security and integration of the Crypto.org Chain, and the speed and cost-efficiency of Polygon, ensuring a seamless, immersive, and rewarding experience for our users in the Rainbowland Metaverse.

Join us today and become a part of the Metaverse Ecosystem with limitless possibilities!
