# üè° The Metaverse Houses and Assets

Welcome to the Rainbowland Metaverse, where creativity and innovation come to life! In addition to our LANDs sale, we're excited to introduce our virtual Houses and Assets, designed to enrich your experience in this immersive virtual world.

Our unique two-layer structure allows us to offer a diverse range of Houses and Assets, while catering to the preferences of our users across different blockchains:

Layer 1: Houses and Assets on the Cronos blockchain (Crypto.com NFT Marketplace) Layer 2: Separate collections of Houses and Assets on the Polygon blockchain (OpenSea and Rarible marketplaces)

Here's a brief overview of Houses and Assets in both layers:

Layer 1 Houses and Assets (Cronos): In this layer, we offer a mix of Houses and Assets, available exclusively on the Crypto.com NFT Marketplace. Users can purchase, trade, and showcase these virtual properties and items, which are designed to enhance the overall look, functionality, and value of their LANDs in the Rainbowland Metaverse.

Layer 2 Houses and Assets (Polygon): This layer features separate collections of Houses and Assets, which can be accessed through popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible. By leveraging the speed and cost-efficiency of Polygon, we aim to provide our users with an expansive range of options to customize and improve their LANDs in the Metaverse.

The availability of Houses and Assets across both layers allows us to cater to a wide audience, while also taking advantage of the unique benefits offered by each blockchain:

1. Cronos (Layer 1): Fast, secure, and scalable, Cronos offers seamless integration with the Crypto.com ecosystem, allowing us to offer exclusive virtual properties and items to our users.
2. Polygon (Layer 2): As a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Polygon enables faster and cheaper transactions, making it possible for us to reach a broader audience through popular NFT marketplaces like OpenSea and Rarible.

Join us today and unlock the limitless possibilities of the Rainbowland Metaverse! Customize your LANDs with our stunning Houses and Assets, and immerse yourself in a vibrant ecosystem of exploration, learning, and entertainment.
