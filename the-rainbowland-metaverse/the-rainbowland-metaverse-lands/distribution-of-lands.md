# ‚úà Distribution of LANDs

Greetings from the Rainbowland Metaverse development team! We understand the importance of ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience for our users, especially when it comes to the distribution of LANDs from Layer 1 (CDC) to Layer 2 (Cronos).

To make this process as simple as possible, we've designed a user-friendly and automated system. Here's how it works:

1. Once the Layer 1 LANDs have been successfully purchased and registered on the Crypto.com NFT Marketplace (CDC), our system will automatically detect the ownership of these LANDs.
2. The system will then cross-reference the ownership information with the coordinates of the LANDs in Layer 2 (Cronos).
3. Users who own LANDs on Layer 1 will be automatically entitled to receive the same coordinates LANDs on Layer 2. Our smart contract will facilitate the distribution, ensuring the process is secure and transparent.

For example, if a member owns a plot of 10 contiguous LANDs (Plot) on Layer 1, they will automatically receive the same 10 LANDs with identical coordinates on Layer 2. This process will be seamless and won't require any additional input from the user.

By implementing this straightforward and efficient system, we aim to enhance user experience and facilitate a seamless transition between the two layers, allowing our users to fully enjoy the benefits and opportunities offered by the Rainbowland Metaverse.

We are committed to ensuring the best experience for our community members as they explore, learn, and have fun in the Rainbowland Metaverse. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to seeing you in our virtual world!\

Attention! LAND owners from Layer 1 will retain their current coordinates if they submit their migration address before December 31, 2023. If they miss this deadline, their coordinates will unfortunately be lost. Don't let this opportunity slip away! üåêüìÜ #LANDMigration
