# âœˆ $RaVerse Migration

In addition to its launch on the [Polygon blockchain, $RaVerse](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x1cb142c4b127a457a587271f33bd04ce8274f8ce) is also available on the Cronos blockchain. The contract address for the [$RaVerse coin on the Cronos blockchain](https://cronoscan.com/token/0xd504ab14f8a0eef1c2044b312aa645e027787e97).

It's important to note that the $RaVerse coin on the Cronos blockchain will be migrated to the $RaVerse coin on the Polygon blockchain. This migration is part of the project's efforts to provide users with a more efficient and cost-effective platform to operate on.

All $RaVerse coin holders on the Cronos blockchain will receive the same amount of $RaVerse coins on the Polygon blockchain automatically. This means that there will be no need for users to perform any manual action to migrate their coins. The process will be seamless and automatic.

Migrating to the Polygon blockchain provides several benefits to users. One of the key benefits is faster and cheaper transactions compared to the Cronos blockchain. The Polygon blockchain is known for its fast transaction speed and low fees, which makes it an ideal platform for users to operate on. Additionally, the Polygon blockchain is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means that users can leverage the existing Ethereum infrastructure to interact with the $RaVerse platform.

In summary, $RaVerse is available on both the Cronos and Polygon blockchains, and the $RaVerse coin on Cronos will migrate to the Polygon blockchain. All $RaVerse coin holders on Cronos will receive the same amount of $RaVerse coins on the Polygon blockchain automatically. Migrating to the Polygon blockchain provides users with faster and cheaper transactions, as well as compatibility with the existing Ethereum infrastructure.

The exact date for the migration of the $RaVerse coin from the Cronos blockchain to the Polygon blockchain has not been announced yet. However, the project team has indicated that the date for the migration will be announced soon.
