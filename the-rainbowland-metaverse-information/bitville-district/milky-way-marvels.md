Welcome to **Milky Way Marvels**, a groundbreaking iNFT experience where gaming, science, and cutting-edge technology merge into a visionary journey across the galaxy.

More than a game, Milky Way Marvels is a **cosmic simulation of exploration, terraforming, and resource colonization**, powered by blockchain and enriched with artificial intelligence.
