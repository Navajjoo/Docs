# 🏝 The Rainbowland Metaverse LANDs

Rainbowland Platform - the Metaverse built on blockchain for top-notch content creation using NFTs and Unreal Engine 5 in web3 & real world engagement.

Welcome to the Rainbowland Metaverse! We are excited to introduce our innovative virtual world, powered by advanced AI technology, offering endless opportunities for play, education, and entertainment. Our vision is to create an immersive and vibrant ecosystem where people can explore, learn, have fun, and earn rewards.

To achieve this, we've designed the Rainbowland Metaverse using a two-layer structure:

[<mark style="color:blue;">**Layer 1: The Rainbowland Metaverse LANDs on Cryptocom NFT Marketplace**</mark>](https://crypto.com/nft/collection/3faa85afc4d85ccd2f6109828bb3e49a) <mark style="color:blue;">**(CDC)**</mark>, migrated to own contract in the Cronos chain. \
\
[<mark style="color:orange;">**Layer 2. Own contract. The Rainbowland LANDs.  Listed and verified on Ebisu's Bay platform.**</mark>](https://app.ebisusbay.com/collection/rainbowland-lands) <mark style="color:orange;">**Official Barnd on Ebisu's Bay.**</mark>

* X: -128 up to 511
* Y: -128 up to 511

Total: 409600 LANDs

1 LAND = 16 meters by 16 meters (256 sq.m.) = 2755 square feet = 0.063 Acre\

LAND owners from Layer 1 will retain their current coordinates if they submit their migration address before December 31, 2023. If they miss this deadline, their coordinates will unfortunately be lost. Don't let this opportunity slip away! 🌐📆 #LANDMigration
