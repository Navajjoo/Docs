# Distribution of HOUSEs and ASSETs

Greetings from the Rainbowland Metaverse development team! We understand the importance of ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience for our users, especially when it comes to the distribution of Houses and Assets across Layer 1 (Cronos) and Layer 2 (Polygon).

To make this process as simple as possible, we've designed a user-friendly and automated system. Here's how it works:

1. Once users successfully purchase Houses and Assets on Layer 1 (Cronos) via the Crypto.com NFT Marketplace, our system will automatically detect the ownership of these virtual properties and items.
2. The system will then cross-reference the ownership information with the respective Houses and Assets collections on Layer 2 (Polygon).
3. Users who own Houses and Assets on Layer 1 will be eligible to access the equivalent Layer 2 collections, which may vary in design or functionality, offering a diverse range of options. Our smart contract will facilitate the distribution, ensuring the process is secure and transparent.

For example, if a member owns a collection of 5 Houses and 10 Assets on Layer 1, they will be able to access the corresponding Layer 2 collections. This process will be seamless and won't require any additional input from the user.

By implementing this straightforward and efficient system, we aim to enhance user experience and facilitate a seamless transition between the two layers, allowing our users to fully enjoy the benefits and opportunities offered by the Rainbowland Metaverse.

We are committed to ensuring the best experience for our community members as they explore, learn, and have fun in the Rainbowland Metaverse. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to seeing you in our virtual world!
