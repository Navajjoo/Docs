# ðŸ™‰ Distribution of Golden Ape (GOLD)

Greetings from the Rainbowland Metaverse development team! We understand the importance of ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience for our users, especially when it comes to the distribution of Golden Ape from Layer 1 (Cronos) to Layer 2 (Polygon).

To make this process as simple as possible, we've designed a user-friendly and automated system. Here's how it works:

1. Once the Layer 1 Golden Ape have been successfully purchased and registered on the Crypto.com NFT Marketplace (Cypto.org Chan), our system will automatically detect the ownership of these Golden Ape.
2. The system will then cross-reference the ownership information with the Golden Ape collection in Layer 2 (Polygon).
3. Users who own Golden Ape on Layer 1 will be automatically entitled to receive the same Golden Ape on Layer 2. Our smart contract will facilitate the distribution, ensuring the process is secure and transparent.

For example, if a member owns 3 Golden Ape on Layer 1, they will automatically receive the same 3 Golden Ape on Layer 2. This process will be seamless and won't require any additional input from the user.

By implementing this straightforward and efficient system, we aim to enhance user experience and facilitate a seamless transition between the two layers, allowing our users to fully enjoy the benefits and opportunities offered by the Rainbowland Metaverse.

We are committed to ensuring the best experience for our community members as they explore, learn, and have fun in the Rainbowland Metaverse. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to seeing you in our virtual world!
